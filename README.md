# Bouncer

Bouncer screens iMessages for you, and lets you know when you get important ones.

## Demo

## Setup

0. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/meltylabs/bouncer.git`
2. Run with `uv run bouncer.py`

## Customize your bouncer

You can customize your bouncer by updating the `SHIBBOLETH` and `GATEKEEPER_PROMPT` variables in `bouncer.py`.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.12 (but I think this will work on most versions)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
